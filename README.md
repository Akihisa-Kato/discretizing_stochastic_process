## Discretizing Stochastic Process

This project is to discretize stochastic process by using Tauchen (1986) and Rouwenhorst (1995) methods, which are widely used implemetation of approximating AR(1) process in economics.
Currently C++ and Julia codes are available.


## Description
# Tauchen (1986)
1. "tauchen.cpp": C++ code of Tauchen method
2. "tauchen.jl": Julia code of Tauchen method

# Rouwenhorst (1995)
3. "rouwenhorst.cpp": C++ code of Rouwenhorst method
4. "rouwenhorst.jl": Julia code of Rouwenhorst method
